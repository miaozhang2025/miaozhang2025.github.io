    <h1>FLash drought and terrestrial ecosystems</h1>
    <p>I work on studying the <b>interactions between vegetation and droughts</b> and applying <b>eddy covariance</b>, <b>remote sensing</b>, <b>machine learning models</b>, and <b>land surface models</b> to analyze <b>climate extreme's impacts</b> under climate change. My research aims to help predict and mitigate the effects of droughts on ecosystems.</p>
