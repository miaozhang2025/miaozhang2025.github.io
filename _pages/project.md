## 🌵 Flash Drought and Terrestrial Ecosystems  
Flash droughts—rapid‐onset, intense drying events—pose major risks to vegetation and carbon fluxes. My work combines eddy covariance, remote sensing,  and climate diagnostics to quantify how vegetation resistance and productivity respond to flash droughts across multiple ecosystems.

### Key Publications
- **Zhang et al., 2025, Nature Communications**  
  *A pronounced decline in northern vegetation resistance to flash droughts from 2001–2022.*  
  — Reveals declining ecosystem resilience under warming, based on satellite productivity and atmospheric drivers.

- **Zhang & Yuan, 2020, Hydrology and Earth System Sciences (HESS)**  
  *Global flash drought impacts on carbon fluxes.*  
  — Shows how flash droughts suppress GPP and increase ecosystem carbon losses, particularly in semi-arid regions.

  *Remote sensing detection of flash drought onset.*  
  — Demonstrates the use of satellite-based vegetation health indicators to identify early flash drought signals.

## 🌿 Vegetation Greening and Drought Interactions  
Vegetation greening trends interact strongly with drought processes. My research investigates how long-term increases in vegetation productivity alter drought feedbacks, water–carbon coupling, and soil moisture sensitivity.

## 💧 Water Budget Change and Human Activity  
Human activities—including groundwater extraction, irrigation, and land-use change—substantially modify the terrestrial water cycle. I study how these processes alter evapotranspiration, runoff generation, and drought evolution.

### Key Publication  
- **Zhang & Yuan, 2019, Journal of Hydrology (JH)**  
  *Human impacts on evapotranspiration and water balance.*  
  — Shows how anthropogenic activities reshape basin-scale ET patterns and can intensify or alleviate drought risk.
