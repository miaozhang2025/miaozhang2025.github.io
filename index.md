Hello! My name is Miao Zhang (张苗). I am currently a State Scholarship Post-Doctoral Fellow at UC Berkeley and a lecturer at Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology. My research focuses on drought, vegetation–climate interactions, and machine learning–based drought forecasting.

I received my Ph.D. in Atmospheric Science from the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

## Research interests

- Flash drought impacts on ecosystem productivity  
- Soil moisture memory under climate change  
- Hybrid physics–ML frameworks for drought prediction  

I leverage satellite observations, land surface models, and deep learning approaches to understand and predict drought processes and their ecological impacts.
