## My Research

I work on studying the **interactions between vegetation and droughts** and applying **machine learning models**, **remote sensing**, and **land surface models** to predict **the changes in climate extremes' impact** under climate change. My research aims to help predict and mitigate the effects of droughts on ecosystems.
